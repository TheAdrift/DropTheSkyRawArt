Narration:
An upswelling affection for the place, the people in it: for friends, lovers, and fondly held rivals; for family and nursed bruises.
Every tingle of this surging oceanic feeling that traced her spine, she felt through emulated ganglia, reported to her prosthesis.
The desire to - if only she could! - enfold the globe and be held in return.
Tempered somewhat by the knowlege that this world was too big for her, and she for it.
An unworkable arrangement, and yet: Home.
The place she was born.
