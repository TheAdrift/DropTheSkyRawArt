WE begin as we often do: bodies in space, falling each to another.

The names we give these make no difference. Freefall suggests no convention

















sense data

these are sense data

Freefall assigns no convention to these sense data, and while that terrifies some folk,
it puts a thrill in her stomach [it sharpens her]

Out here, only dust lanes, penumbral glow, scattered radiation.
No names. No cardinal points.
Features without maps.

She throws her mind, open, into gimbal-lock,
assembling a context for herself, the planet, the ship's long axis.

Only the dance, only the relation from body to body,
only the falling matters.

It puts a thrill in her stomach.






Out here, penumbral gloaming and scattered light. Features without names.
No maps. No cardinal points. These are secondary.

Freefall assigns nothing except by convention.







It is sometimes useful to construe the larger of several bodies as "down."
Sometimes, "up." Any variation thereof.

One chooses the convention to suit the purpose. Freefall imposes nothing.

Only the dance matters. Only the way body relates to body; 
only the fall matters. Beyond that, all reference frames are made equal.

This terrifies some people. She lives for it.

She catches herself on sunrise and lets her mind precess through these relationships.

It puts a thrill in her stomach.

Construe the larger of several bodies as down, if you like. Or as anything else.
Freefall imposes nothing. She prefers "beside."

All that matters is the falling.

She drifts sunward in penumbral glow,
lets her mind precess through several relations.

Plotting. Re-plotting. Placing herself, the planet, the ship's long axis, into context.

Each moment a fulcrum, the cosmos poised on it, pivoting.

It puts a thrill in her stomach.
