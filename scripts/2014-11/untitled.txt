WE begin as we often do: bodies in space, falling each to another.

The names we give these make no difference. Freefall suggests no convention

















sense data

these are sense data

Freefall assigns no convention to these sense data, and while that terrifies some folk,
it puts a thrill in her stomach [it sharpens her]

Out here, only dust lanes, penumbral glow, scattered radiation.
No names. No cardinal points.
Features without maps.

She throws her mind, open, into gimbal-lock,
assembling a context for herself, the planet, the ship's long axis.

Only the dance, only the relation from body to body,
only the falling matters.

It puts a thrill in her stomach.






Out here, penumbral gloaming and scattered light. Features without names.
No maps. No cardinal points. These are secondary.

Freefall assigns nothing except by convention.
