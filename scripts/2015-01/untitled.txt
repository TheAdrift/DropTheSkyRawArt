Familiar bearings, now.

Tracing the deep, curving grooves carved from sandy plains. Shallow crater seas that she remembers like a lover's face.

A face veiled by water cloud, like the vapour gathered where her fingers met the cool glass

\\

Where her fingers met the cool glass, a lace of cloud

the condensation from her breath

\\

Unable to pick out her fathers' ranch among the flecks of green
the shallow crater seas

Where her fingers met the cool glass, tracing the grooved, sandy plains, shallow crater seas she remembered like a lover's face,

\\

Where her fingers met the cool glass, and smeared the condensation from her breath, a lace of cloud

obscuring shallow crater seas that she remembers like a lover's face.
A veil.

She felt, quite suddenly, a swelling desire for this silent globe.
{It's the veil; {None of them have worn a veil; {that's new};};};

\\


A vertiginous feeling in that, a pleasurable rising in her middle that she uses to sharpen herself in the morning. Or for a crisis.

No crises lately. Not sure if that's more fortunate or less.

Where her fingers met the cool glass Zöe traced familiar grooves and shorelines.

Red rock. Sandy plains. She can't pick out her fathers' ranch among the green that flecks the coasts and windward mountain faces. She never could.

Shallow crater seas remembered like a lover's face, veiled by water clouds, a smudge of condensation from her breath.

She waited for the flash from solar panels as the Terminal crested the horizon.

That done, and with a hundred little things left to do, she turned and tugged the stirrup on the pilot's console.

As she passed it, she glanced again at the readouts. Don't spend too long on ephemerides; all the numbers green, blinking politely. Altitude, eccentricity, argument of periapse, all read as they should.
Star finder still aligned, still tracking.

Zöe shoved off, passing into the main artery, where ventilation currents pressed and tugged her clothes and she allowed herself one shiver, ninety-seven little things still pulling her along.
