Familiar bearings, now.

Tracing the deep, curving grooves carved from sandy plains. Shallow crater seas that she remembers like a lover's face.

A face veiled by water cloud, like the vapour gathered where her fingers met the cool glass

\\

Where her fingers met the cool glass, a lace of cloud

the condensation from her breath

\\

Unable to pick out her fathers' ranch among the flecks of green
the shallow crater seas

\\
Where her fingers met the cool glass, tracing the grooved, sandy plains, shallow crater seas she remembered like a lover's face,

\\

Where her fingers met the cool glass, and smeared the condensation from her breath, a lace of cloud

obscuring shallow crater seas that she remembers like a lover's face.
A veil.

She felt, quite suddenly, a swelling desire for this silent globe.
{It's the veil; {None of them have worn a veil; {that's new};};};

\\

Where her fingers met the cool glass ZÃ¶e traced familiar grooves and shorelines.

Shallow crater seas she remembered like a lover's face.
