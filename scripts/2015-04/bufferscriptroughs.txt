The Terminal:
Rosa's port of entry, the gateway to its small but burgeoning interplanetary economy.

A pier extending from the shore of the cosmic ocean.

Literally humming with human life and all its accoutrements--

if your lidar is sensitive enough, with good signal processing you can even hear it, rumbling to the surface of the Anchor.

One of the tug operators waved through a porthole at her. She thought it might be Alex.



Zöe's trip down the thread passed uneventfully.

Three days to the surface spent making the rounds

ninety-seven little things drawing her along.

Zöe's elevator ride passed uneventfully, with one disappointment at the pier

when she caught, or imagined she caught, a dock operator wave to her as their capsule tethered the ship into port,

then waited half an hour at the docks for Alex to come off her shift.

Half-hour gone, and a queue growing for the elevator cab, Zöe talked her way to Alex's empty locker and stuffed a note inside the vent.

The remaining three-day's journey to the surface Zöe spent mostly by the elevator's phone connection,

or making the rounds among her employer's various contacts.

There were forms to be filled, manifests in need of checking, items to declare, contracts to scout.

Requiring regular attention, all this routine, all of it important, and none of it particularly life-threatening, the business primarily a social proposition.

So Zöe made calls on public terminals, to people whom she'd never met, whose numbers she'd memorized,

and wondered if her friend of many years, whose number sat in a disused contact list, was riding this very elevator or had caught the next.
